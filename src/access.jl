"""
Default-Access-Restriction for all countries

with "street", "track", and "service" introduced as `:yes` for all modes.
Individual regions can provide their own access restriction dictionaries.

### Interpretation
* `yes` - this kind of vehicle is allowed to drive on this kind of road unless
    tagged otherwise on the individual way (e.g. "motorcar=no").
* `designated` - same as yes but this road can optionally be preferred by some
    of your metrics.
* `no` - this kind of vehicle is not allowed to drive on this kind of road
    unless tagged otherwise on the individual way (e.g. "motorcar=yes").
